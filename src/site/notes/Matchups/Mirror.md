# Notes
- Don't spam crouch MK too much if your opponent has super if they've shown they can punish it
- One of the most common things Kens do is dash in crouch MK; parry it if they overuse it
- If you don't have another super after you land SA3 in the corner, taunt > stand HK does great damage and will catch low parries
- After SA3 in the corner, you are perfectly spaced for (taunt >) UOH > SA3

> [!danger]- Raw SA3 punish
> crouch HP
