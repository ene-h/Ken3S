# Notes
- Don't spam crouch MK too much if your opponent has super if they've shown they can reversal punish it
- One of the most common things Kens do is dash in crouch MK; parry it if they overuse it
- If you don't have another super after you land SA3 in the corner, taunt > stand HK does great damage and will catch low parries
- After SA3 in the corner, you are perfectly spaced for (taunt >) UOH > SA3
- Try to whiff punish crouch MK, even if it's just with sweep
- When you block TC xx EX Hadouken in the corner you can do reversal SA3
	- Same with couch MK xx EX Hadouken, unless the crouch MK is spaced pretty far
