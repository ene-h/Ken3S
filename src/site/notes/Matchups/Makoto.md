# Character specific stuff
### Shoryu-shoryu
- Stand HP shoryu kara-shoryu
- Stand MP/crouch MK shoryu kara-shoryu
###### CORNER:
- [[General stuff/Terminology#Target combo\|TC]] LP shoryu LP/MP shoryu (plink MP into LP to make the timing easier)
### UOH setup
- Crouch LK > crouch MP
- Close MP > crouch MP
### SA3 cross-up setup
- Walk forward regular jump. 
- Hold down forward, crouch LP superjump HK (immediate timing does a cross-up, later lands in front. Mask a walk forward with the LP whiff.) 
### Crouch LK>LP>LK
- YES (also LK>LK>LK)
### Shoryu confirm
- Crouch LK > crouch LP xx Shoryu
### Corner cross-up jump
- NO
***
# Notes
- Spam crouch LK in neutral, confirm into SA3, catches forward dash (good against round start dash)
	- Look at the air while you do this to catch her juming
- Makotos love jumping around, use EX air tatsu > DP or stand MK
- On standing Makoto, use [[General stuff/Terminology#Target combo\|TC]] xx MP DP xx SA3
- Watch out for instant air EX Tsurugi oki
- Tsurugi alters her jump arc quite a lot

> [!danger]- Raw SA3 punish
> Stand HP
