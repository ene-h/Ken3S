# VS MAKOTO
### Shoryu-shoryu
- Stand fierce shoryu kara-shoryu
- Stand strong/low forward shoryu kara-shoryu
###### CORNER:
- [[General stuff/Terminology#Target combo\|TC]] jab shoryu jab/strong shoryu (plink strong into jab to make the timing easier)
### UOH setup
- Low short > low strong
- Close strong > low strong
### Shippu cross-up setup
- Walk forward regular jump. 
- Hold down forward, crouch jab superjump roundhouse (immediate timing does a cross-up, later lands in front. Mask a walk forward with the jab whiff.) 
### Short jab short
- YES (also short short short)
### Notes
- Post hayate?
	- Block
	- Jump back
	- Jump towards
- Spam low short in neutral, confirm into shippu, catches forward dash
- Makotos love jumping around, use EX air tatsu > DP or stand forward
- On standing Makoto, use [[General stuff/Terminology#Target combo\|TC]] xx strong DP xx Shippu

> [!danger]- Raw Shippu punish
> Stand fierce
