# Notes
- EX air tatsu is a good air to air
- Keep distance
	- I usually just end up running away for 99 seconds...
- [[General stuff/Terminology#Cancel buffering\|Cancel buffering]] crouch HP xx SA3 is not a bad idea
- On crouching Hugo, far HP links to super (2f)
- You get basically nothing on cross-up MK, only like max +4
- You can TC xx MP DP xx SA3 on crouching Hugo
- Don't get hit by the meme Ass-Move (Hugo crouch HK), it's an overhead

Towards HP

Lariat (any) (MP DP xx SA3 seems is also possible and seems most reliable)
