# Character specific stuff
### Shoryu-shoryu
- Stand MP/crouch MK shoryu shoryu 
###### CORNER:
- [[General stuff/Terminology#Target combo\|TC]] LP shoryu LP/MP shoryu (plink MP into LP to make the timing easier)
### UOH setup
- crouch MP > crouch LK
### SA3 cross-up setup
- crouch LP super jump mk. Holding down helps
### Crouch LK>LP>LK
- NO
### Shoryu confirm
- Crouch LK > crouch LP xx Shoryu  (whiffs when Necro is hit crouching)
***
# Notes
- Fast wakeup, no taunt after corner SA3 if you want a [[General stuff/Terminology#Meaty\|meaty]]
- Use stand MP > super in neutral
- You can LP DP from pretty far to catch limbs (risky)
- LP spin hook is +1, necro players will often press back MP after this and maybe mix it up with crouch LK or snake fang
- You can down parry drill to avoid cross-ups, but that often doesn't allow you to punish
- When you high parry drill, the most consistent option is to just DP immediately
- Throw range is a little further than Ken's
- Post SA3 cross-up is not that good
- Good necro players will whiff-punish (crouch) MK and HK with super
- Reaction DP drill
- Watch for round start snake fang
- Has a lot of bad hitboxes, so make sure to buffer double [[General stuff/Terminology#Quarter Circle\|QCF]] after crouch / stand MP in case you stuff something
- You can cross though his quick-stand with a dash
