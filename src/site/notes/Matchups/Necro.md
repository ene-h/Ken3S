### Shoryu-shoryu
- Stand strong/low forward shoryu shoryu 
###### CORNER:
- [[General stuff/Terminology#Target combo\|TC]] shoryu shoryu 
### UOH setup
- Low strong > low short
### Shippu cross-up setup
- Low jab super jump mk. Holding down helps
### Short jab short
- NO
### Shoryu confirm
- Crouch short > crouch jab xx Shoryu  (whiffs when Necro is hit crouching)
### Notes
- Fast wakeup, no taunt after corner shippu if you want a meaty
- Use stand strong > super in neutral
- You can jab DP from pretty far to catch limbs (risky)
- Jab spin hook is +1, necro players will often press back strong after this and maybe mix it up with snake fang
- You can down parry drill to avoid cross-ups
- When you high parry drill, the most consistent option is to just DP immediately
- Throw range is a little further than ken
- Shippu cross-up is not that good
- Good necro players will whiff-punish (crouch) forward and roundhouse with super
- Reaction DP drill
- Watch for round start snake fang
- Has a lot of bad hitboxes, so make sure to buffer double qcf after crouch / stand strong in case you stuff something
