### Shoryu-shoryu
###### Corner:
- [[General stuff/Terminology#Target combo\|TC]] shoryu kara-shoryu 
### UOH setup
- Close strong > low strong
### Shippu cross-up setup
- Hold down, stand jab, superjump roundhouse. Timing determines cross-up
### Short jab short
- YES (also short short short)
### Shoryu confirm
- NONE
### Notes
- Why tf cold blue kick so hard to parry (can block low tho)
- Don't get blue nocturned
- Remy gets more reward from throw in the corner so might press throw more than other chars
- React DP CBK?
- SA1 is plus on block
- SA2 comboes from anti-airs and hits frame 2
- Parry second hit of sweep
- Roundhouse CBK escapes corner and anti-airs
