# Notes
- Why tf cold blue kick so hard to parry (can block low tho)
- Don't get blue nocturned
- Remy gets more reward from throw in the corner so might press throw more than other chars
- React DP CBK?
- SA1 is plus on block
- SA2 comboes from anti-airs and hits frame 2
- Parry second hit of sweep (not a red parry, to my surprise)
- HK CBK escapes corner and anti-airs
- I don't have enough Remy experience - *If you have suggestions to improve this wiki, feel free to send me a Discord message in the [3S server](https://discord.com/invite/8hWg5GF) or the [Ken server](https://discord.gg/s5Kfy3e2sU) @ene_h*
