# Notes
- Perfect spacing for UOH after SA3 in corner
- (Red) parry crouch MK xx hadouken
- Has a good kara-throw
- You can usually punish any meterless tatsu with crouch MK
- EX Hadouken is always 0 on block when done as a cancel, you have to red parry the last hit (and risk getting knocked down) for a punish
- There's a 4 pixel range where if you block Ryu crouch MK at the very tip, you cannot punish with reversal SA3

> [!danger]- Raw SA3 punish
> Far HP
