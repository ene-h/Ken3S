# Notes
- Against penguin kicks (flying double kicks => backflip): parry first hit xx LP DP
- Ken stand HK is a good button to use here
	- Stand MK can catch jumps and towards MK/HK
- Towards MK (overhead hopkick, plus a billion on block) is "safe" on parry when spaced (EX DP always gets at least 2 hits) (when done too close you can parry > LP DP)
- Her LP is +6, used for trapping, interrupting is a gamble
	- Maybe jump
	- Maybe crouch MP + crouch tech
	- Maybe shoryu
	- Maybe low parry (standing jabs can be low parried as well as high parried)
- Do not mindlessly go into super, a lot of her moves get her off the ground, and if she is hit out of them SA3 will whiff due to air-reset status
- She has multiple 2-hit jump-ins
- Her jump is very fast (almost as fast as Dudley's) but try to anti-air, at least somewhat
	- *Jump back HK is good and low risk. Walk under > button as well* \- BigGameJames
- After her EX DP, she can only come down with air normals if it hits. If you parry it, you can walk under to switch sides before you punish. 

> [!danger]- Raw SA3 punish
