# Notes
- Stuff dash-punches with stand MP, crouch MP (or ex hadouken)
	- You can often parry it on reaction, takes some practice though
- Backdash and buffer super motion if you get hit by dash-punch if they like to command-grab after
- Walk forward instead of dashing, less risk getting dash-punched
- Don't get wakeup super-ed
- Good kara-throw, especially dangerous when Q is cornered (backthrow)
- They may crouch LP xx SA2 on wakeup
- His low buttons are otherwise not very scary, you should probably do high parries more than low parries
	- [[General stuff/Terminology#Hadou-walk\|Hadou-walking]] helps here
- Little fun bonus: when you double DP Q, you can usually get LP DP > MP DP (I usually plink MP into LP to double my chances)
- You can link SA3 if you hit Q with far HP while he's crouching
	- It only hits him crouching during a small part of his normal idle animation
	- It also hits him out of some crouching buttons
	- The SA3 link is quite late
- Far HP is a decent option to cover neutral jumps
