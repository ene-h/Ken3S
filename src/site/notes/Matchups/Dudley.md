### Crouch LK>LP>LK
- YES (also LK>LK>LK)
***
# Notes
- Use far HP as anti-air
- On crouching Dudley, use TC xx MP DP xx SA3 or [[General stuff/Terminology#Target combo\|TC]] xx HP DP
- Low parry > stand block > watch for crouch HK on wakeup to partly avoid Dudley's MPest mix-up
- Crouch HP xx SA3 to stuff buttons
- Watch out for whiff punishes with stand HK into big damage
	- Use EX hadou if they overuse this
	- Maybe try stand MP whiffpunish, or buffer the [[General stuff/Terminology#Quarter Circle\|QCFs]] and raw SA3 it
	- If they're constantly doing it, you don't really have to worry about reacting to it, just walk up and crouch MK him, he pushes button, he gets hit
	- If you want to push a button to contest the space, Ken's far HP is probably pretty good and prevents Dudley from jumping much
- You can SA3 when you block a normal xx ducking

> [!danger]- Raw SA3 punish
> ###### (Almost all of Dudley's normals are plus)
> Crouch MK
