### Shoryu-shoryu
- NO
### UOH setup
- Close strong > low strong
### Shippu cross-up setup
- Walk forward slightly superjump to cross-up. Superjump to land in front.
### Short jab short
- YES (also short short short)
### Notes
- Use far fierce as anti-air
- On crouching Dudley, use TC xx strong DP xx Shippu or TC xx fierce DP
- Low parry > stand block > watch for low roundhouse on wakeup to partly avoid Dudley's strongest mix-up
- Watch out for whiff punishes with stand HK into big damage, use EX hadou if they overuse this

> [!danger]- Raw Shippu punish
> ###### (Almost all of Dudley's normals are plus)
> Crouch forward
