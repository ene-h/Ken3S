# VS DUDLEY
### Shoryu-shoryu
- NO
### UOH setup
- Close strong > low strong
### Shippu cross-up setup
- Walk forward slightly superjump to cross-up. Superjump to land in front.
### Short jab short
- YES (also short short short)
### Notes
- Use far fierce as anti-air
- On crouching Dudley, use TC xx strong DP xx Shippu or [[General stuff/Terminology#Target combo\|TC]] xx fierce DP
- Low parry > stand block > watch for low roundhouse on wakeup to partly avoid Dudley's strongest mix-up
- Crouch fierce xx shippu to stuff buttons
- Watch out for whiff punishes with stand HK into big damage
	- Use EX hadou if they overuse this
	- Maybe try stand strong whiffpunish, or buffer the qcfs and raw shippu it
	- If they're constantly doing it, you don't really have to worry about reacting to it, just walk up and low forward him, he pushes button, he gets hit
	- If you want to push a button to contest the space, Ken's far fierce is probably pretty good and prevents Dudley from jumping much at the range you'd be pushing it into Dud RH as well
