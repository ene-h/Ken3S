# Notes
- Use far HP as anti-air (and maybe as a [[General stuff/Terminology#Whiff punish\|whiff punish]] for Dudley stand HP)
- Make sure you don't whiff buttons like stand MP, prime target for Dudley stand HK
- On crouching Dudley, use TC xx MP DP xx SA3 or [[General stuff/Terminology#Target combo\|TC]] xx HP DP
- Low parry > stand block > watch for crouch HK on wakeup to partly avoid Dudley's strongest mix-up
	- Sometimes you just gotta DP... If you NEVER EVER DP they can just pressure mindlessly
- Crouch HP xx SA3 to stuff buttons (sparingly, it's a big commitment and you're left pretty open for punishes)
- Watch out for [[General stuff/Terminology#Whiff punish\|whiff punishes]] with stand HK into big damage
	- If you want to push a button to contest the space, Ken's far HP is probably pretty good and prevents Dudley from jumping much
	- EX hadou if they're just spamming it
	- If they're constantly doing it, you don't really have to worry about reacting to it, just walk up and crouch MK him, he pushes button, he gets hit
- You can SA3 when you block a normal xx ducking
- The red parry on one-two-three is not that hard, and not that dangerous if you mess up. You can parry the last hit low if that's easier for you.
- You can cross though his quick-stand with a dash in the corner, it's a gimmick so use sparingly
