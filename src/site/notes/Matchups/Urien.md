### Shoryu-shoryu
- Stand strong/low forward shoryu kara-shoryu
###### CORNER: 
- [[General stuff/Terminology#Target combo\|TC]] jab shoryu jab/strong shoryu (plink strong into jab to make the timing easier)
### UOH setup
- Close strong > low strong
### Shippu cross-up setup
- Walk up jump over whiff roundhouse/fierce for meter. You can also dash up -> walk back.
### Short jab short
- NO
### Notes
- Use [[General stuff/Terminology#Target combo\|TC]] xx strong DP xx shippu when Urien is crouching
- Play safe and let him hang himself, Urien has a lot of health
- Shut him down with lights
- He has no reversal, but headbutt dodges Ken's low kick normals
- His dash is very fast
- Don't jump too much or risk anti-air fireball into a million tackles and corner pressure
- Try [[General stuff/Terminology#Cancel buffering\|cancel buffering]] crouch fierce xx shippu to stuff Urien's normals
	- It even beats his low forward, which he does not get much off of, but it's a very annoying poke
- EX tatsu cross-up is hard to punish for Urien
- Don't let him build meter, but don't start rushing him down like an idiot either, stay in a threatening range
- Meaty-ing him is very risky when he has more than half a bar
	- TC, crouch forward, or sweep are not great options
	- short short is safer, also fierce delay DP OS to catch parries
	- Deep jump-ins are -6 on parry so you won't get launchered
- Tech after whiffed or blocked headbutts or l.dp him out of them
- Parry or punish tackles
- Spamming neutral jump or neutral jump roundhouse? => 
	- Far fierce!
	- EX air tatsu
	- dash DP
	- walk up DP
	- parry xx DP
- Very fast wakeup (you don't get oki after a forward throw midscreen, only 12f advantage)
- Urien has no answer for lk tatsu on block
- You can dash > strong xx DP if you parry sweep

> [!danger]- Raw Shippu punish
> Far fierce (shake my hand) (1f)
