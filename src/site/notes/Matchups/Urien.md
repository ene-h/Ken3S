# VS URIEN
### Shoryu-shoryu
- Stand strong/low forward shoryu kara-shoryu
###### CORNER: 
- [[General stuff/Terminology#Target combo\|TC]] jab shoryu jab/strong shoryu (plink strong into jab to make the timing easier)
### UOH setup
- Close strong > low strong
### Shippu cross-up setup
- Walk up jump over whiff roundhouse/fierce for meter. You can also dash up -> walk back.
### Short jab short
- NO
### Notes
- Use [[General stuff/Terminology#Target combo\|TC]] xx strong DP xx shippu when Urien is crouching
- He has no reversal, but headbutt dodges Ken's low forward
- His dash is very fast
- Don't jump too much- anti-air fireball into a million tackles and corner pressure!!
- Try [[General stuff/Terminology#Cancel buffering\|cancel buffering]] crouch fierce xx shippu to stuff Urien's normals
	- It even beats his low forward, which he does not get much off of, but it's a very annoying poke
- EX tatsu cross-up is hard to punish for Urien

> [!danger]- Raw Shippu punish
> Far fierce (shake my hand)
