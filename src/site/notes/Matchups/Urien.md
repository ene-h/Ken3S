# Notes
- Use [[General stuff/Terminology#Target combo\|TC]] xx MP DP xx SA3 when Urien is crouching
- Play safe and let him hang himself, Urien has a lot of health
- He has no reversal, but headbutt dodges Ken's low kick normals
- His dash is very fast
- Don't jump too much or risk anti-air fireball into a million tackles and corner pressure
- Try [[General stuff/Terminology#Cancel buffering\|cancel buffering]] crouch HP xx SA3 to stuff Urien's normals
	- It beats his crouch MK, which he does not get much off of, but it's a very annoying poke
	- It can also beat his stand HP
- EX tatsu is hard to punish for Urien
- Don't let him build meter, but don't start rushing him down like an idiot either, stay in a threatening range
- [[General stuff/Terminology#Meaty\|Meaty-ing]] him is very risky when he has more than half a bar
	- TC, crouch MK, or sweep are not great options
	- Crouch LK>LK is safer, also [[General stuff/Oki#Stand HP\|HP delay DP OS]] to catch parries
	- Deep jump-ins are -6 on parry so you won't get launchered (but still get backthrown)
- Tech after whiffed or blocked headbutts or LP DP him out of them if you're sauced
- Parry or punish tackles (even if it's just a sweep - make sure he can't tackle for free)
- Spamming neutral jump or neutral jump HK? => 
	- Far HP!
	- EX air tatsu
	- dash DP
	- walk up DP
	- parry xx DP
- Very fast wakeup (you don't get much[[General stuff/Terminology#Okizeme\| oki ]]after a forward throw mid-screen, only 12f advantage)
- Urien has no answer for LK tatsu on block except for red parry
	- Ken players better than me cancel it off of crouch LK instead of crouch MK; idk why
	- If you're cracked you can cancel the close hit of tatsu to SA3 to hitconfirm, it requires a very fast super motion
- You can dash > close MP xx DP if you parry sweep
- Wakeup backdash is sometimes pretty good while Urien has bar, when he might want to grab > aegis
- If you're whiffing crouch MP to build meter, you can get clipped by random tackle, so it's risky especially when Urien has bar
- When Urien is whiffing stand MP to build meter, you can counterpoke with far HP
- Whiffpunishing his crouch HK on reaction is viable, crouch MK is too hard for me (extended hurtbox disappears after 16 frames and Ken's crouch MK is active on frame 7, so it's a 9-10f reaction)
