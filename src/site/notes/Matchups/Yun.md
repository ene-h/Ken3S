# Notes
- Parry xx DP divekick
- Red parry shoulder if they like to do 123 xx Shoulder xx Activate
- (Hard) Red parry 123 > HP > (genei activation) > MP DP xx SA3 
- Watch out for dive kick cross-up in the corner (mostly on your wake-up)
- High connect blocked dive kick into button is usually not real (blue parry)
- Jump towards HK works well against divekicks
	- Jump towards EX tatsu (juggle with stand MK or MP DP) is more rewarding (do the DP motion early so it has the chance to auto correct)
	- Crouch LP > crouch LK > crouch LK xx SA3 has potential against divekicks
- Against ambiguous cross-up divekick, press throw. It's often too minus to accomplish anything
- Against corner divekick mix-up, press the stick towards the corner with parry timing, if he crosses up you'll get parry, otherwise you just stand block.
