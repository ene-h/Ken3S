# VS GOUKI
### Shoryu-shoryu
- Close strong/low forward xx shoryu > kara-shoryu
###### CORNER: 
- [[General stuff/Terminology#Target combo\|TC]] xx jab shoryu > jab/strong shoryu (plink strong into jab to make the timing easier)
### UOH setup
- Low short > low strong
### Shippu cross-up setup
- Whiff stand strong -> Superjump.
- Walk forward, jump whiff roundhouse.
- Dash -> walk backward -> jump whiff roundhouse.
- Standing jab superjump roundhouse.
### Short jab short
- YES
### Notes
- Make sure to punish heavy tatsu (raw shippu) so your opponent is discouraged from spamming it
- Parry divekick xx shoryu OR parry divekick > low forward xx strong shoryu xx shippu
- Don't get wakeup demon'd or KKZ'd
- Anti-air demon flip (they can't air-parry) or dash under
- Gouki air tatsu often seems to beat ken ex air tatsu, otherwise ex air tatsu is pretty good against a gouki that likes to bounce around
- Dash under air fireball
- Consider using shoryu instead of shippu punishes for stun
- His kara-throw goes far
