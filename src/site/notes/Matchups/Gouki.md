# Notes
- Make sure to punish heavy tatsu (raw SA3) so your opponent is discouraged from spamming it
- Parry divekick xx shoryu OR parry divekick > crouch MK xx MP shoryu xx SA3
- Don't get wakeup demon'd or KKZ'd
	- I sometimes jump back HK on their wakeup when they have 2 bars, it mostly beats both
- Anti-air demon flip (they can't air-parry) or dash under
- Gouki air tatsu often seems to beat Ken ex air tatsu and other air to airs, otherwise ex air tatsu is pretty good against a gouki that likes to bounce around
- Dash under air fireball
- Consider using shoryu instead of SA3 punishes for stun
- His kara-throw goes far
