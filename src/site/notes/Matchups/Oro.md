### Shoryu-shoryu
###### CORNER: Stand HP shoryu kara-shoryu
### UOH setup
-  Close MP > crouch MP
### Shippu cross-up setup
- (Down MK) Superjump air tatsu to cross-up.
- Superjump whiff normal to land in front. Tiger knee motion 
### Crouch LK>LP>LK
- YES
### Shoryu confirm
- Crouch LK > crouch LK xx Shoryu
### Notes
- Oro's far MK beats Ken’s crouch MK (Oro’s farthest-reaching poke)
	- Crouch HP xx shippu beats this clean, can be [[General stuff/Terminology#Cancel buffering\|cancel buffered]]
- You can shoryu through his fireballs and hit his hand
- UOH after shippu in the corner is a little harder, you have to crouch cancel the recovery of shippu into taunt, and UOH as soon as possible. This way the UOH hits meaty, it's not a spacing thing
- Kara more than doubles his throw range

> [!danger]- Raw Shippu punish
> Stand HP
