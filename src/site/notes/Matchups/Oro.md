# Notes
- Lame him out
- Oro's far MK beats Ken’s crouch MK (Oro’s farthest-reaching poke)
	- Crouch HP xx SA3 beats this clean, can be [[General stuff/Terminology#Cancel buffering\|cancel buffered]]
- You can shoryu through his fireballs and hit his hand
- UOH after SA3 in the corner is a little harder, you have to crouch cancel the recovery of SA3 into taunt, and UOH as soon as possible. This way the UOH hits [[General stuff/Terminology#Meaty\|meaty]], it's not a spacing thing (works on standing hit)
- UOH is easier to get plus-frames due to Oro's low crouch hurtbox
- Kara more than doubles his throw range
- If you dash in, you risk getting uppercutted into unblockables
- Getting parried while in range of Oro stand MP is also a death sentence, be wary of what range you press which buttons
- Stay patient, it's an endurance match
- If he resets you with SA2 in the corner, it's probably a better idea to eat it than to parry and get mixed due to damage scaling
- If Oro has 1.5 bar, he can probably loop you to death
	- That's why it's very risky to go for[[General stuff/Terminology#Okizeme\| oki ]]when he has bar - you risk losing off of one parry
- Priority #1 is "don't get hit"
- Oro players will often try to get a stand MP after an air-to-air parry situation
- Far crouch MK > crouch HP xx SA3 is a spacing trap against Oro stand MK and HK
- Crouching Oro falls out of TC xx DP

> [!danger]- Raw SA3 punish
> Stand HP
