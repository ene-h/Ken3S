# Notes
- Oro's far MK beats Ken’s crouch MK (Oro’s farthest-reaching poke)
	- Crouch HP xx SA3 beats this clean, can be [[General stuff/Terminology#Cancel buffering\|cancel buffered]]
- You can shoryu through his fireballs and hit his hand
- UOH after SA3 in the corner is a little harder, you have to crouch cancel the recovery of SA3 into taunt, and UOH as soon as possible. This way the UOH hits [[General stuff/Terminology#Meaty\|meaty]], it's not a spacing thing
- UOH is easier to get more plus due to Oro's low crouch
- Kara more than doubles his throw range

> [!danger]- Raw SA3 punish
> Stand HP
