- YES (or LK>LK>LK)
### Shoryu confirm
- Crouch LK > stand LP xx Shoryu (CORNER ONLY)
***
# Notes
- Raw SA3 punish blocked full EX rekka!
- Red parry crouch MK xx rekka (maybe not that good, turns out he can delay it)
	- LP Rekka and EX Rekka have similar timings
- Parry xx DP dive kicks seems most consistent
	- Parry xx TC is also not bad, if you happen to catch them standing you can confirm DP or SA3
- High connect blocked dive kick into button is usually not real (blue parry)
- Not quick-rising gives more time for stun bar to recover and disrupts Yang's oki setups, so sometimes it's good not to quick-rise EX slash
- Crouch MK is good in footsies, remember to use it
- Sometimes you just have to reversal
- Watch out for walk up crouch MK when you expect dive kick
- Stand MK is sometimes good as [[General stuff/Anti-air\|anti-air]]
	- If they jump-in with parry a lot, not a bad idea to do crouch HP > shoryu or tatsu (mix up the strengths)
- Watch out for dive kick cross-up in the corner (mostly on your wake-up)
- Jump towards HK works well against divekicks
	- Jump towards EX tatsu (juggle with stand MK or MP DP) is more rewarding (do the DP motion early so it has the chance to auto correct)
	- Crouch LP xx crouch LK xx SA3 has potential against divekicks
- Against ambiguous cross-up divekick, press throw. It's often too minus to accomplish anything
- Against corner divekick mix-up, press the stick towards the corner with parry timing, if he crosses up you'll get parry, otherwise you just stand block.
- Stand HK is a pretty good button to press at 1/2 screen away
- When you have low health, a lot of Yangs will try to finish you off with command grab combo's
	- If you read them doing this (and you're not cornered) you can backdash and buffer raw super or do crouch MK xx (confirm) SA3.
- If you block a divekick and Ken blocks with his elbow up, Yang is minus (and follow up parries will be blue parries)
