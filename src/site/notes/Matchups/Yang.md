### Shoryu-shoryu
###### CORNER: 
- Stand HP shoryu kara-shoryu
### UOH setup
- crouch LK > crouch MP
### Shippu cross-up setup
- Walk up -> superjump. Air tatsu after a superjump for cross-up.
### Crouch LK>LP>LK
- YES (or LK LK LK)
### Shoryu confirm
- Crouch LK > stand LP xx Shoryu (CORNER ONLY)
### Notes
- Shippu punish blocked full EX rekka!
- Red parry crouch MK xx rekka (maybe not that good, turns out he can delay it)
- Parry xx DP dive kicks seems most consistent
- High connect blocked dive kick into button is usually not real (blue parry)
- Not quick-rising gives more time for stun bar to recover and disrupts Yang's oki setups, so sometimes it's good not to quick-rise EX slash
- Crouch MK is good in footsies, remember to use it
- Sometimes you just have to reversal
- Watch out for walk up crouch MK when you expect dive kick
- Stand MK is sometimes good as anti air
- Watch out for dive kick cross-up in the corner (mostly on your wake-up)
