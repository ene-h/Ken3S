### Shoryu-shoryu
###### CORNER: 
- Stand fierce shoryu kara-shoryu
### UOH setup
- Low short > low strong
### Shippu cross-up setup
- Walk up -> superjump. Air tatsu after a superjump for cross-up.
### Short jab short
- YES (or short short short)
### Notes
- Shippu punish blocked full EX rekka!
- Red parry rekka (maybe not that good, turns out he can delay it even when canceling from crouch forward)
- Parry xx DP dive kicks seems most consistent
- High connect blocked dive kick into button is usually not real (blue parry)
- Not quick-rising gives more time for stun bar to recover and disrupts Yang's oki setups, so sometimes it's good not to quick-rise EX slash
- Crouch forward is good in footsies, remember to use it
- Sometimes you just have to reversal
- Watch out for walk up low forward when you expect dive kick
