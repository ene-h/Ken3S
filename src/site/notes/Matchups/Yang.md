***
# Notes
- Raw SA3 punish blocked full EX rekka (if they do some funky rhythm it apparently doesn't punish...)
- Red parry crouch MK xx rekka (maybe not that good, turns out he can delay it)
	- LP Rekka and EX Rekka have similar timings
- Not quick-rising gives more time for stun bar to recover and disrupts Yang's[[General stuff/Terminology#Okizeme\| oki ]]setups, so sometimes it's good not to quick-rise EX slash
- Crouch MK is good in footsies, remember to use it
- Sometimes you just have to reversal
- Watch out for walk up crouch MK when you expect dive kick
- Stand MK is sometimes good as [[General stuff/Anti-air\|anti-air]]
	- If they jump-in with parry a lot, not a bad idea to do crouch HP > shoryu or tatsu (mix up the strengths)
- If you block a divekick and Ken blocks with his elbow up, Yang is minus (90% of the time you get a free throw - but kinda hard to react to)
	- Ambiguous cross-up divekick is usually like this
	- After such a divekick, Yang's buttons will probably not combo on hit
		- You might be able to interrupt with crouch tech > low LK > confirm SA3
- Jump towards HK works well against divekicks
	- Jump towards EX tatsu (juggle with stand MK or MP DP) is more rewarding (do the DP motion early so it has the chance to auto correct)
- Watch out for dive kick cross-up in the corner (mostly on your wake-up)
	- Against corner divekick mix-up, press the stick towards the corner with parry timing, if he crosses up you'll get parry, otherwise you just stand block.
- Stand HK is a pretty good button to press at 1/2 screen away
	- It's an easy EX Rekka if you whiff it though 
- When you have low health, a lot of Yangs will try to finish you off with command grab combo's
	- If you read them doing this (and you're not cornered) you can backdash and buffer raw super or do crouch MK xx (confirm) SA3.
- He has no reversal apart from super, you should pressure him on wakeup, especially in the corner
	- Yang might wakeup jump a lot, stand MP will stuff that
- Crouching twins fall out of TC xx DP
