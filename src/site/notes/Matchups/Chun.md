# Notes
- Use UOH > SA3 in neutral
- ~~Low parry instead of trying to [[General stuff/Terminology#Whiff punish\|whiff punish]] chun's crouch MK
	- It's whiffpunishable, just hard
	- Sometimes the Chun will let SA2 rip even on parry
		- I sometimes forego the punish if I get the parry if they do this much
		- Better players will however delay their punish just enough so they can block the SA2 if it comes out (time it so you input your punish during the super flash - if it happens)
- Try high parrying in Chun's stand HP range
	- [[General stuff/Terminology#Hadou-walk\|Hadou-walking]] is key here
- You can high parry Chun's sweep
- Reaction parry hazanshu
- After SA3 in the corner, you are perfectly spaced for (taunt >) UOH > SA3
- You can use raw SA3 as a [[General stuff/Terminology#Whiff punish\|whiff punish]] for Chun back HP
- [[General stuff/Terminology#Whiff punish\|Whiff punish]] Chun stand HP with stand MP - not a lot of damage, but you might make them consider not spamming it. You are almost certainly too far for linking SA3 off it though
- Fireballs aren't bad when she has no bar
- Post SA3 meaty UOH setup: whiff low LK, super jump whiff HK, UOH > DP [(clip by Big Red)](https://clips.twitch.tv/TacitRenownedSquirrelOhMyDog-PwC6SMUVDJc0OjOP)
- Sweep is a key button when she has no meter
- When you forward parry Chun in the corner, it's best to immediately DP, chances are she pressed close HK and superjump cancels
- You can counter-poke Chun HP with crouch HP xx SA3 from about half screen away (I don't know how good this is yet) 
- Same with Chun back+HP but a little closer
- Against wake-up EX SBK:
	- Instead of crouch LK x2 as a meaty, do crouch LK > crouch LP
		- The LP will only come out on hit or block, so if Chun reversals you will block in time
	- To punish on block:
		- Raw SA3
		- MP DP xx SA3
		- LP DP
		- Crouch MK seems very unreliable for some reason

> [!danger]- Raw SA3 punish
> crouch MP (neko-pan / cat punch)
