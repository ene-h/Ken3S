# Notes
- Use UOH > SA3 in neutral
- ~~Low parry instead of trying to [[General stuff/Terminology#Whiff punish\|whiff punish]] chun's crouch MK
	- It's whiffpunishable, just hard
	- Sometimes the Chun will let SA2 rip even on parry
		- I sometimes forego the punish if I get the parry if they do this much
		- Better players will however delay their punish just enough so they can block the SA2 if it comes out (time it so you input your punish during the super flash - if it happens)
- Try high parrying in Chun's stand HP range
- You can high parry Chun's sweep
- Reaction parry hazanshu
- After SA3 in the corner, you are perfectly spaced for (taunt >) UOH > SA3
- You can use raw SA3 as a [[General stuff/Terminology#Whiff punish\|whiff punish]] for Chun back HP
- [[General stuff/Terminology#Whiff punish\|Whiff punish]] Chun stand HP with stand MP - not a lot of damage, but you might make them consider not spamming it. You are almost certainly too far for linking SA3 off it though
- Fireballs aren't bad when she has no bar
- Post SA3 meaty UOH setup: whiff low LK, super jump whiff HK, UOH > DP [(by Big Red)](https://clips.twitch.tv/TacitRenownedSquirrelOhMyDog-PwC6SMUVDJc0OjOP)

> [!danger]- Raw SA3 punish

> Close HK (knee) (1F) (if they superjump cancel you're fucked)

> (Can also get MP DP xx SA3, easier when stand-blocking)
