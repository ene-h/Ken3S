### Shoryu-shoryu
- NO
### UOH setup
- Close strong > low strong
### Shippu cross-up setup
- Crouch jab -> Superjump forward
### Short jab short
- YES
### Shoryu confirm
- Crouch short > crouch jab xx Shoryu 
### Notes
- **ANTI AIR HIM** (use far fierce instead of DP sometimes, maybe with a buffer to short tatsu if you get close fierce and they parry)
- Stand / crouch strong buffer super to stuff Alex (hitboxes)
- Reaction parry elbow (good connections only)
- Shippu elbow on block
- Do not accept wifi challenges
- Alex evades a lot of [[General stuff/Oki\|Oki]], be careful
- Parry stomp (you block if it crosses up)
- Duck DDT (and don't stand up right before it hits like an idiot)
- Alex players love to evade kens crouch forward with crouch strong
- Alex has long recovery on key moves, so whiff punish, even if its just sweep or raw super
- Don't whiff to build meter too much, especially if Alex has meter for EX elbow

> [!danger]- Raw Shippu punish
> Crouch fierce (I'm pretty sure Alex is considered standing the entire time, can also do crouch forward xx strong DP xx shippu)

> Crouch roundhouse (close range you can add crouch forward, long range it will work even if the first hit of shippu whiffs)
