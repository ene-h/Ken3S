# Notes
- **ANTI AIR HIM** (use far HP instead of DP sometimes, maybe with a buffer to LK tatsu if you get close HP and they parry)
- Stand / crouch MP buffer super to stuff Alex (hitboxes)
	- Don't let it rip when you're far
- Reaction parry elbow (damned wifi players)
- SA3 elbow on block
- Alex evades a lot of [[General stuff/Oki\|Oki]], be careful
	- [[General stuff/Oki#Stand HP\|Stand HP anti parry OS]] can work against parry and stomp
	- If you do the shoryu confirm with stand LP, you can sometimes block the stomp in time
- Parry stomp (you block if it crosses up)
- Duck DDT (and don't stand up right before it hits like an idiot)
- Alex players love to evade kens crouch MK with crouch MP
	- Alex crouch MP is both a low- and high parry
- Alex has long recovery on key moves, so [[General stuff/Terminology#Whiff punish\|whiff punish]], even if its just sweep or raw super
- Don't whiff to build meter too much, especially if Alex has meter for EX elbow

> [!danger]- Raw SA3 punish
> Crouch HP (I'm pretty sure Alex is considered standing the entire time, can also do crouch MK xx MP DP xx SA3)

> Crouch HK (close range you can add crouch MK, long range it will work even if the first hit of SA3 whiffs)
