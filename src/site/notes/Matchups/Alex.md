### Shoryu-shoryu
- NO
### UOH setup
- Close MP > crouch MP
### Shippu cross-up setup
- Crouch LP -> Superjump MK
### Crouch LK>LP>LK
- YES
### Shoryu confirm
- Crouch LK > crouch LP xx Shoryu 
### Notes
- **ANTI AIR HIM** (use far HP instead of DP sometimes, maybe with a buffer to LK tatsu if you get close HP and they parry)
- Stand / crouch MP buffer super to stuff Alex (hitboxes)
- Reaction parry elbow (damned wifi players)
- Shippu elbow on block
- Alex evades a lot of [[General stuff/Oki\|Oki]], be careful
- Parry stomp (you block if it crosses up)
- Duck DDT (and don't stand up right before it hits like an idiot)
- Alex players love to evade kens crouch MK with crouch MP
- Alex has long recovery on key moves, so whiff punish, even if its just sweep or raw super
- Don't whiff to build meter too much, especially if Alex has meter for EX elbow

> [!danger]- Raw Shippu punish
> Crouch HP (I'm pretty sure Alex is considered standing the entire time, can also do crouch MK xx MP DP xx shippu)

> Crouch HK (close range you can add crouch MK, long range it will work even if the first hit of shippu whiffs)
