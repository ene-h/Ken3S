# Notes
- Mallet smash is 2 slow parries, EX is fast
- She has a 2-hit jump-in
- Far kara-throw
- Has lots of overheads
- Back HK (big wheel kick) is +4, and dodges throw
- Elena might want to poke a lot with stand MK, whiff-punish with crouch MK xx SA3
- Stand HK is good in neutral, stuffs a lot of stuff including mallet smash
