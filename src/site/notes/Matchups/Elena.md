# VS ELENA
### Shoryu-shoryu
-  Stand strong/low forward shoryu shoryu
###### CORNER:
- [[General stuff/Terminology#Target combo\|TC]] xx jab shoryu > jab/strong shoryu (plink strong into jab to make the timing easier)
### UOH setup
- Close strong > low strong
### Shippu cross-up setup
- Superjump, timing determines cross-up. Down forward superjump helps with cross-up.
### Short jab short
- YES
### Notes
- Mallet smash is 2 slow parries, EX is fast
- She has a 2-hit jump-in
- Far kara-throw
- Lots of overheads
- Back roundhouse (big wheel kick) is +4, and dodges throw
- It's harder for Elena to parry stuff like fireballs, because of her moving hurtboxes in her neutral stance
- Whiff-punish neutral and back roundhouse with sweep (or raw super if you're nice with it)
- Elena might want to poke a lot with stand forward, whiff-punish with crouch forward xx shippu
