# LP DP
- Not truly invincible, but makes Ken's hurtbox small  so it can go through a lot of moves anyway
- Used for [[General stuff/Shoryu-shoryu\|Shoryu-shoryu]]
- Rewarding (if you get the juggle) but risky anti-air
- Can sometimes go through fireballs
# MP DP
- Does more damage than HP when canceled into SA3
- Looks like LP but is 2 hits, good for mixing up anti-air
- In the corner, you can juggle with this one (see [[Ken#MATCHUP VS\|matchup pages]])
# HP DP
- Actually meterless invulnerable!
- Most damage in meterless punish combos without double shoryu
- 3 hits and only the last one launches, opponent may fall out
	- This makes it a decent anti-air against jump-in single parry
- Can catch very high jumps like Necro's
# EX DP
- A lot of invulnerable frames
- 4 hits, opponent seems to fall out often
- I barely use it, except as maybe an anti air
