# Jab, Strong, Fierce
Old names for LP, MP and HP
# Short, Forward, Roundhouse
Old names for LK, MK and HK
# Cancel buffering
Most often used with crouch MK xx SA3 or crouch HP xx SA3
> *[Whiffing](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Whiff "See Term: Whiff") a [normal attack](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Normal "See Term: Normal") in front of you, and inputting another attack as a [cancel](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Cancel "See Term: Cancel") afterwards. When your attack whiffs, nothing further happens, but if your opponent accidentally runs into the attack, the cancel happens automatically. This is a very common [option select](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Option Select "See Term: Option Select") that will really help you get more mileage out of your strong [pokes](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Poke "See Term: Poke"), and you don't have to take any extra risk! You just do the same inputs and let the game take the correct action based on what your opponent does.*
# Target combo
Ken's target combo is close MP > close HP
> *A character-specific attack that lets a [normal](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Normal "See Term: Normal") cancel into another, different normal. Some target combos go on for longer too, sometimes stringing together 3 or 4 normals into a long attack sequence. It's important to note these are specifically programmed to only certain characters, and often appear in their move lists as a unique ability.*
# Crouch tech
>*A technique in some games where you try to [tech a throw](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Throw Tech "See Term: Throw Tech") while you are crouching, and if a throw never comes, your tech attempt becomes a relatively low risk crouching [normal](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Normal "See Term: Normal") instead. This only works in a few games though, since many modern games will simply force you to [whiff](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Whiff "See Term: Whiff") a throw if you try to tech, even if you are crouching. Street Fighter IV is the most famous example of a game where crouch teching (and other throw tech [option selects](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Option Select "See Term: Option Select"), like [four finger teching](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Four Finger Tech "See Term: Four Finger Tech")) is a very common defensive strategy.*
# Delay tech
>*Trying to defend against being [thrown](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Throw "See Term: Throw") by inputting a [throw tech](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Throw Tech "See Term: Throw Tech") a little late on purpose. Delayed tech (also called "late tech") is an [option select](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Option Select "See Term: Option Select"); you want to try and [block](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Block "See Term: Block") in case they attack, and if they throw, pressing the buttons slightly late means you will still successfully throw tech, since the [window](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Window "See Term: Window") for teching throws can be a little bigger.*  
  
>*This is one of the first defensive techniques new players should learn if they are playing a Street Fighter-like game, since it lets them defend against basic attacks and basic throws at the same time. Powerful stuff! It's not foolproof though â€” once you get into intermediate play, a player can just slightly delay their _own_ attack to [counter hit](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Counter Hit "See Term: Counter Hit") your late tech attempt. But when your opponent hesitates like this, that can open up other ways for you to defend too! You'll start to see the [mind games](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Mind Game "See Term: Mind Game") of offense and defense when you get good at stuff like this, but start with delayed techs first!*
# Guard jump
> *On wake-up, there's 6 frames of throw invulnerability. If you block for 6 frames, input a jump and go back to blocking you will block meaties and jump throws.*
# Meaty
> *An attack that hits an opponent on the very first frame possible after they rise from a [knockdown](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Knockdown "See Term: Knockdown") (or other similar situations, like being [flipped out](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Flipout "See Term: Flipout")). This guarantees the opponent **must** either block the attack, or immediately do an [invincible](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Invincible "See Term: Invincible") move (like a [dragon punch](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Dragon Punch "See Term: Dragon Punch")). If they just press any random button, they will get [counter hit](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Counter Hit "See Term: Counter Hit") because their attack still has to go through its non-hitting [startup](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Startup "See Term: Startup"), but your attack is already [active](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Active "See Term: Active") on top of them. Learning how to time a meaty is extremely important to fighting game strategy, and you can often just beat beginners by meatying them over and over as they insist on attacking at all times.*
# Shimmy
>*Tricking someone into thinking you're going to [throw](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Throw "See Term: Throw") them by walking close, and then, at the last second, walking backwards out of range so they [whiff](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Whiff "See Term: Whiff") a [throw tech](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Throw Tech "See Term: Throw Tech") attempt like a dummy. You can then pummel them with a huge [punish](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Punish "See Term: Punish").*
>**Crouch tech makes this less effective.**
