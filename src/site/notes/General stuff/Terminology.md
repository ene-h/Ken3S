Most often used with crouch MK xx SA3 or crouch HP xx SA3
> *[Whiffing](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Whiff "See Term: Whiff") a [normal attack](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Normal "See Term: Normal") in front of you, and inputting another attack as a [cancel](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Cancel "See Term: Cancel") afterwards. When your attack whiffs, nothing further happens, but if your opponent accidentally runs into the attack, the cancel happens automatically. This is a very common [option select](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Option Select "See Term: Option Select") that will really help you get more mileage out of your strong [pokes](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Poke "See Term: Poke"), and you don't have to take any extra risk! You just do the same inputs and let the game take the correct action based on what your opponent does.*
# Target combo
Ken's target combo is close MP > close HP
> *A character-specific attack that lets a [normal](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Normal "See Term: Normal") cancel into another, different normal. Some target combos go on for longer too, sometimes stringing together 3 or 4 normals into a long attack sequence. It's important to note these are specifically programmed to only certain characters, and often appear in their move lists as a unique ability.*
# Crouch tech
>*A technique in some games where you try to [tech a throw](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Throw Tech "See Term: Throw Tech") while you are crouching, and if a throw never comes, your tech attempt becomes a relatively low risk crouching [normal](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Normal "See Term: Normal") instead. This only works in a few games though, since many modern games will simply force you to [whiff](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Whiff "See Term: Whiff") a throw if you try to tech, even if you are crouching. Street Fighter IV is the most famous example of a game where crouch teching (and other throw tech [option selects](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Option Select "See Term: Option Select"), like [four finger teching](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Four Finger Tech "See Term: Four Finger Tech")) is a very common defensive strategy.*
# Delay tech
>*Trying to defend against being [thrown](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Throw "See Term: Throw") by inputting a [throw tech](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Throw Tech "See Term: Throw Tech") a little late on purpose. Delayed tech (also called "late tech") is an [option select](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Option Select "See Term: Option Select"); you want to try and [block](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Block "See Term: Block") in case they attack, and if they throw, pressing the buttons slightly late means you will still successfully throw tech, since the [window](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Window "See Term: Window") for teching throws can be a little bigger.*  
  
>*This is one of the first defensive techniques new players should learn if they are playing a Street Fighter-like game, since it lets them defend against basic attacks and basic throws at the same time. Powerful stuff! It's not foolproof though â€” once you get into intermediate play, a player can just slightly delay their _own_ attack to [counter hit](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Counter Hit "See Term: Counter Hit") your late tech attempt. But when your opponent hesitates like this, that can open up other ways for you to defend too! You'll start to see the [mind games](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Mind Game "See Term: Mind Game") of offense and defense when you get good at stuff like this, but start with delayed techs first!*
# Guard jump
> *On wake-up, there's 6 frames of throw invulnerability. If you block for 6 frames, input a jump and go back to blocking you will block meaties and jump throws.*
# Meaty
> *An attack that hits an opponent on the very first frame possible after they rise from a [knockdown](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Knockdown "See Term: Knockdown") (or other similar situations, like being [flipped out](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Flipout "See Term: Flipout")). This guarantees the opponent **must** either block the attack, or immediately do an [invincible](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Invincible "See Term: Invincible") move (like a [dragon punch](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Dragon Punch "See Term: Dragon Punch")). If they just press any random button, they will get [counter hit](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Counter Hit "See Term: Counter Hit") because their attack still has to go through its non-hitting [startup](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Startup "See Term: Startup"), but your attack is already [active](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Active "See Term: Active") on top of them. Learning how to time a meaty is extremely important to fighting game strategy, and you can often just beat beginners by meatying them over and over as they insist on attacking at all times.*
# Shimmy
>*Tricking someone into thinking you're going to [throw](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Throw "See Term: Throw") them by walking close, and then, at the last second, walking backwards out of range so they [whiff](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Whiff "See Term: Whiff") a [throw tech](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Throw Tech "See Term: Throw Tech") attempt like a dummy. You can then pummel them with a huge [punish](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Punish "See Term: Punish").*

**Crouch tech makes this less effective.**

# Hit confirm
> *Performing an attack, seeing that your attack successfully hit, and then [reacting](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Reaction "See Term: Reaction") to this information by continuing the [combo](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Combo "See Term: Combo"). That is to say, you "confirm" that your first attack hit before you launch further attacks, and if the attack was blocked instead, you stop and don't follow through with anything else. This is important because, usually, you will be [canceling](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Cancel "See Term: Cancel") into a move that would be [unsafe](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Unsafe "See Term: Unsafe") if it was blocked, so you only want to do it if it won't get you killed.  *
  
**You can look at the score to confirm. It updates 1 frame earlier than the life bar.**

# Option Select
#### Also known as: OS

> *A situation where performing the same inputs can lead to several different outcomes depending on how the characters interact. Often abbreviated as "OS". A common option select is the [buffer](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Buffer "See Term: Buffer"): press a [normal](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Normal "See Term: Normal") attack and then try to [cancel](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Cancel "See Term: Cancel") into a [special](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Special Move "See Term: Special Move"). If you do this from far away, the normal attack will [whiff](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Whiff "See Term: Whiff") and your special cancel does nothing. However, if your opponent gets hit by your attack, the special cancel will work automatically, without any extra thought or changes to the input on your part.  
>   
> Good option selects tend to reduce the burden on a player to perfectly predict or react to everything happening in the game. You can perform one set of inputs, and the game will "select an option" automatically depending on what the other character did. Some OSes are common enough that we even give them names: [delayed tech](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Delayed Tech "See Term: Delayed Tech") (try to block and throw tech), [safe jumps](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Safe Jump "See Term: Safe Jump") (try to attack and block), and [fuzzy guard](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Fuzzy Guard "See Term: Fuzzy Guard") (try to block multiple directions) are all specific examples of option selects that will help the player cover multiple choices at the same time.*

# Frame trap
> Two attacks back-to-back that leave a very small [gap](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Gap "See Term: Gap") between them. The gap will be shorter than the defender's fastest attack, which means if they try to attack with a [normal](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Normal "See Term: Normal"), they will get [counter hit](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Counter Hit "See Term: Counter Hit"). Finding effective frame traps requires some basic understanding of [frame data](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Frame Data "See Term: Frame Data") (or finding a good Youtube tutorial that has done the work for you!); you'll usually be looking for an attack that is [plus](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Plus "See Term: Plus") on block, which lets you attack before your opponent afterwards, then swinging with a fast attack that "traps" your opponent who foolishly thought they could swing themselves.  
>   
> Frame traps aren't foolproof, though. You can usually just continue to [block](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Block "See Term: Block") and be fine until your opponent gets [pushed out](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Pushback "See Term: Pushback") of range. Or, if you're feeling [risky](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Risk "See Term: Risk"), you can try to get through the opponent's attack with an [invincible](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Invincible "See Term: Invincible") [reversal](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Reversal "See Term: Reversal"), which doesn't care about your opponent's pesky [frame advantage](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Frame Advantage "See Term: Frame Advantage").

# Chip Damage
> *Damage dealt to a character while they are [blocking](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Block "See Term: Block"). Most [special moves](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Special Move "See Term: Special Move") will deal chip damage when blocked; the amount varies by game, but it is usually between 10-25% of the move's regular damage. Many games let you [K.O.](https://glossary.infil.net/?t=K.O. "See Term: K.O.") an opponent via chip damage, although Street Fighter V is a notable modern day exception. Street Fighter Alpha 3 tried to scold players who performed chip damage KOs by flashing "Cheap!" on the screen, but nobody _actually_ felt bad about it.*
