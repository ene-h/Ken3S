Because Ken hasn't got a command grab or fast overhead (which means you can usually get away with down backing on wakeup) his wakeup pressure mostly revolves around him using raw throws or tick throws and then baiting you into teching and confirming into super from it 
### Close Medium Punch 
- CL.MP, Tick Throw 
- CL.MP, Crouching MP xx Super (confirmed) 
- CL.MP, Crouching MP, Dash Throw 
- CL.MP, Standing MP Linked into Super
- Anti parry OS: delay, cancel into DP late so it won't come out on hit or block, only on parry. Catches parry > button and parry > throw. You can mix up the DP strength if they start getting wise to it.
### Crouching Light Kick 
- C.LK, Tick Throw 
- C.LK x 2 xx Super (if hit confirmed) 
- C.LK x 2 Dash Throw (if blocked) 
- C.LK x 2 Dash C.LK x 2 
- C.LK x 2 Medium Kick ( Confirm into super if you see them stand after blocking LKx2) 
- C.LK x 2 Dash LP SRK (if you're feeling saucy) 
**Can use C.LK, C.LP, C.LK if you find that easier** 
### Empty Jump 
- Empty Jump Throw 
- Empty Jump Back Dash (confirm into c.mk xx super if you see a throw whiff) 
- Empty Jump C.LK x 2 xx Super 
- Empty Jump Target Combo xx Super/SRK 
### Cross Up Medium Kick 
- Cross Up MK, Throw 
- Cross Up MK, Target Combo xx Super/SRK) 
- Cross Up MK, Close MP (and post mix ups) 
- Cross Up MK, C.LK (And post mix ups if blocked) 
- Cross Up MK, B+ MK xx Super (use this only if you condition them into blocking low by using C.LK a lot)
### Stand HP
- Stand HP > crouch MP (frame trap)
- Stand HP > [[General stuff/Terminology#Option Select\|OS]] parry
- Anti parry OS: delay, cancel into DP late so it won't come out on hit or block, only on parry. Catches parry > button and parry > throw. You can mix up the DP strength if they start getting wise to it.
