- HP [[General stuff/Special moves#HP DP\|DP]]
- LP DP x 2
- LP DP > MP DP
- Far HP
- Far MP
- Multiple LPs
- Stand MK
- Jump back HK
- Crouch HP
- Close HP late cancel DP or LK [[General stuff/Special moves#Tatsu / Hurricane Kick\|Tatsu]] so it only comes out on parry. After LK Tatsu you can sometimes juggle LP DP
### Parry
- Immediate DP
- crouch MK xx MP DP xx SA3
- [[General stuff/Terminology#Target combo\|TC]] super
- Some stuff is safe on parry, like the second hit of necro drill in some cases, or Ibuki's towards MK hop-kick when spaced.
