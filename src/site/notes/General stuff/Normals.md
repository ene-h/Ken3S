# Throws
### Forward throw
- Good for keeping the corner
- Decent damage
- Bad [[General stuff/Oki\|Oki]] (can't get a meaty back+MK)
### Neutral throw
- Mash throw
	- Good damage when your opponent is bad at mashing (and you can mash pretty well yourself) 
	- Otherwise mediocre damage
- Best [[General stuff/Oki\|Oki]], you can do most of your options except taunt
### Back throw
- Great corner carry
- No [[General stuff/Oki\|Oki]] if you throw them full screen (unless they miss the quickrise)
# Standing Normals
### LP
- Useful for stuffing dashes, part of some Shoryu confirms
- Multiple LPs is good against jump-in parry
### MP
- Far:
	- Great confirm to super
	- Plus on hit or block
	- Decent anti-air or anti UOH or hop-kicks
- Close
	- Part of your target combo
	- Lots of mixups - see [[General stuff/Oki\|Oki]]
### HP
- Far:
	- Decent anti-air, better against some characters, notably Dudley
	- Wins trades against mediums and lights
- Close:
	- Good as an anti-air when you buffer in a late special vs parries
	- Starts your best [[General stuff/Combos\|punish combos]]
	- Useful on [[General stuff/Oki#Stand HP\|oki]]
### LK
- Slightly plus, good for [[General stuff/Terminology#Tick throw\|tick throws]] and not much else
### MK
- Decent anti-air / UOH / hop-kick
- Pretty good range and pretty fast
- Punishable on block, but also parry bait
### HK
- Great spacing tool
- (Mostly) safe
- Does a lot of damage, especially after taunt
- High-parry only
***
# Crouching Normals
### LP
- Part of some Shoryu confirms
- Multiple LPs is good against jump-in parry
- Chains into other lights
- Your [[General stuff/Terminology#Crouch tech\|crouch tech]] button
### MP
- Great super confirm! (learn this one first)
- Lots of mix-ups - see [[General stuff/Oki\|Oki]]
- Good "priority": the hitbox comes out before the hurtbox, so stuffs a lot of moves
	- That's why it's sometimes called emperor punch
- Very plus
- Best normal to whiff when building meter
- High and low parry though
### HP
- Situational anti-air
- Also has a hitbox low to the ground in front of Ken
- Can stuff some attacks pretty well, mostly good against Dudley/Urien/Oro/Hugo when you [[General stuff/Terminology#Cancel buffering\|buffer super]] behind it
### LK
- Main low confirm into super and DP
- Good for tick throws
- Slightly plus
### MK
- Best [[General stuff/Terminology#Poke\|poke]]
- [[General stuff/Terminology#Whiff punish\|Whiff punish]] tool
- Occasionally good as a [[General stuff/Terminology#Meaty\|meaty]]
- Only unsafe vs certain supers, and even then it's hard and risky to punish
- Great for [[General stuff/Terminology#DED OS\|DED OS]]
### HK
- Ken's sweep, knocks down
- VERY unsafe - make sure your opponent gets hit if you try using this
- Less unsafe at max range
- Best normal for punishing far away, i.e.: Urien anti-air fireball

# Command Normals
### Towards MK
- Not very good, punishable on block by some chars
- Not worth using
### Back MK
- 2 hit overhead that confirms to super, good[[General stuff/Terminology#Okizeme\| oki ]]tool
	- The confirm is a [[General stuff/Terminology#1 frame link\|1 frame link]], but it gets way easier if you [[General stuff/Terminology#Piano\|piano]] it
	- Some player can react to this nearly every time
	- Can get red parried
### Towards HK
- Very slow overhead, completely reactable
- Links to super on crouching hit (1 frame link)
- You can hold it for a feint
- Not worth using
	- Not worth using the feint either for that matter
