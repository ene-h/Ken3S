For example, whiff punish Ken 2MK with Urien 2MP, but if it's 2LK or empty crouch, ignore it.
But IMO what goes up with repetition is the decision making process.

What I mean is, you get faster at this process:
- Step 1: See first frame of animation 
- Step 2: Oh, it's animation 1 
- Step 3: Do nothing
Repeat
- Step 1: See the first animation 
- Step 2: Oh, it's animation 2 
- Step 3: Press HP

So it's not so much about reaction. You can be really fast at reacting if there is no decision making involved, just press a button if you see anything.

It's about pressing when you see the right animation and not press when you see a similar animation.

With repetition this process goes faster overtime. Say if you do drills like this every day. So what seemed impossible 2 months ago can become "free" or at least "comfortable".

And if you don't want to do this because it's too tryhard, well keep in mind that this type of thing is already happening every time you play a match, so you can just play and improve at own pace.

When a new player sees a jump, he is much slower at processing "Oh, he jumped" and trying to guard the jump. Brain is slow due to lack of familiarity/exp

Like imagine this, being too slow to guard a jump. But this is a thing for new players. After playing for a while, seeing a jump and guarding it is "free".

You just encounter jumps in matches and in matches there is often decision making element (you are parsing the jump from the other stuff that could happen), so you get quicker

So it will go up regardless. Tryharding is more for uncommon things that you don't see that often in matches, so if you are kind of new, probably better to just have fun with the game. Lots of free gains just from playing normally lol

Anyway, what I wanted to get at is that when people super on block, it's not that their reactions are slow.

They reacted in time. They just reacted to block animation instead of hit animation lol

What's slow is the process of "Is it blocking animation or hit animation? > Do I press or not?"

Well nevermind, I filled the channel with text -.-
