### Hadouken / Fireball
- LP, MP, HP versions travel at different speeds, but are otherwise pretty interchangeable.
- You can cancel into hadouken from crouch MK, but against good players you will get (red) parried and punished. Don't make it a habit, but its fine occasionally. Also enables an easier [[General stuff/Terminology#Hit confirm\|hit confirm]] to SA3, but only close-up, otherwise they can often block.
- Gives you more time to complete the super motion when performing [[General stuff/Terminology#Target combo\|TC]] xx Hadouken xx SA3. Does not give you more time to confirm. Don't let the hadouken rock on block, you will get parried.
### EX Hadouken
- A safer cancel into a knockdown from crouch MK. Beware of overusing this and wasting meter that can go to SA3.
- An OK confirm from target combo when used occasionally. If the TC hits, it's better to go into LP DP, but pretty safe if you let it rip on block: sometimes it catches people tryin to take their turn back after they block TC.

### LP DP / Dragon Punch / Shoryuken
- Not truly invincible, but makes Ken's hurtbox small so it can go through a lot of moves anyway.
- Used for [[General stuff/Shoryu-shoryu\|Shoryu-shoryu]].
- Rewarding (if you get the juggle) but risky [[General stuff/Anti-air\|anti-air]].
- Can sometimes go through fireballs.
- Useful for [[General stuff/Oki#Stand HP\|anti parry OS]].
### MP DP
- Does more damage than HP when canceled into SA3.
- Looks like LP but is 2 hits, good for mixing up anti-air.
- In the corner, you can juggle with this one (see [[Ken#MATCHUP VS\|matchup pages]]).
### HP DP
- Actually meterless invulnerable!
- Most damage in meterless punish combos without double shoryu.
- 3 hits and only the last one launches, opponent may fall out.
	- This makes it a decent anti-air against jump-in single parry.
- Can catch very high jumps like Necro's.
### EX DP
- A lot of invulnerable frames.
- 4 hits, opponent seems to fall out often.
- I barely use it, except as maybe an anti air.
***
### Tatsu / Hurricane Kick
- Not very useful on the ground.
- LK tatsu is the "most" useful, being the safest at -5 on block and -3 on hit. Good vs Urien sometimes.
- Occasional [[General stuff/Terminology#Chip Damage\|chip]] KO usage.
- Can be used instead of a dash to close distance after SA3, since it builds a little meter.
- Air version is also not great, but sometimes useful for an ambiguous cross-up.
- Air version is also used for some [[General stuff/Shippu Cross-ups\|Shippu Cross-ups]].
### EX Tatsu
- On hit, pushes you and the opponent full screen distance. Useful for getting out of the corner.
	- On stand block it's the same, but some characters can crouch it.
- Airborne / throw invulnerable at frame 7, so if you do it with reversal timing on wake-up there's only one frame to throw you.
- Pretty safe, punishable with some supers only.
- Does more damage than EX Hadouken when cancelled from crouch MK or TC. Useful when you have to close out a round and only have half a bar.
- Decent chip KO option.
##### Air EX Tatsu 
- Very fast, almost like a dive-kick when done late.
- When done early after a super jump, makes you soar through the air, good for getting out of the corner.
- Does great damage air-to-air.
- You can often juggle after you hit it.
	- Against a standing opponent, you can usually get stand MK as a juggle.
	- Against some characters you can get stand HK instead.
	- In the corner you can juggle LP DP (> LP/MP DP) 
	- (HARD) midscreen you can dash LP DP (> LP DP)
	- Air to air you can juggle MP DP
